                <div class="text-block-24 texttab _1">&emsp;The vast majority of clinical trials fail to meet their patient recruitment goal. NIH has estimated that 80% of clinical trials fail to meet their patient recruitment timeline and, more critically, many (or most) fail to recruit
                    the minimum number of patients to power the study as originally anticipated. Efficient patient trial recruitment is thus one of the major barriers to medical research, both delaying trials and forcing others to terminate entirely.<br/>‍<br/>&emsp;In
                    this project we built a system to retrieve clinical trials from <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/" target="_blank">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>, a required registry for clinical trials in the United States. The goal is to find clinical
                    trials where patients can be enrolled.<br/>‍<br/>&emsp;The project was divided into three phases, which allowed observing the evolution of the related technology throughout the years. <br/>‍<br/>&emsp;The first phase of the project
                    was about text analysis and matching documents to queries based on certain relevant aspects. In addition, there was a strong component on metrics to analyse the correctness of the matching made before. To do such things, we had to
                    use already given code to read the data and build a Vector Space Model based on it, as well as compute the metrics associated with the trial. Besides that, we had to<br/>implement our own Language Model, based on certain frequencies
                    of words in documents, and use it to score the different documents based on the set of test queries we had. Comparing both approaches with the metrics was essential to understand the best one for each case.<br/><br/>&emsp;The second
                    phase of the project was about learning how to better rank documents, using different sections of the clinical trial document as predictors of the clinical trial relevance for each patient case. To do so, we first had to use the algorithms
                    of the first phase to compute the predictors, scoring the documents accordingly. After that, it was necessary to combine those scores (both LMJM and VSM of different sections) and train a logistic regression to generate the best coefficients
                    to weight the different models for each section. Then we used a test set to calculate an estimate for the true quality of the prediction and calculated the metrics for the new LETOR model.<br/><br/>&emsp;Finally, the theoretical
                    study ended in techniques and algorithms of latest text analysis. The “Word Embeddings” brought an improved way of representing words, based on techniques such as “Word2Vec”, capable of establishing associations between tokens based
                    on semantics. On the other hand, “BERT” allowed to establish relationships between tokens based on the context in which these are found in a particular document.<br/>‍<br/>&emsp;This time, the focus of the third phase of the project
                    was the use of these improved algorithms to represent and visualize relationships between tokens of a given document, as well as program a model capable of classifying relevant and non-relevant documents for a certain “query”.</div>

                <div class="text-block-24 texttab _1">&emsp;For this phase of the project, we subdivided the corpus a lot, choosing only one query and two documents, only one of which was relevant to the query used. For each one of the documents, we only used the “detailed_description”
                    field, since it was enough for the analysis we proposed. We are therefore left with two corpuses, each with a special [CLS] token at the beginning and two other special [SEP] tokens, one that separates the query from the document and
                    another at the end of the corpus.<br/><br/>&emsp;Specifically for the division of the text into tokens and the extraction of their embeddings, it was necessary to use the BERT model (“Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers”).
                    In addition, it was also necessary to visualize the data obtained. For all these reasons, the project was developed in python, with libraries already developed and optimized to solve these problems. Some of the most important are:</div>
                <div
                    class="text-block-24 texttwotabs _1">- transformers (transformer-type models already trained);<br/>- bertviz (view attention on models Transformer type, namely BERT);<br/>- sklearn (notably the PCA and TSNE algorithms to reduce the dimensions of the data used);<br/>- numpy;<br/>-
                    torch (framework for machine learning, namely to work with tensors, matrixes of multiple dimensions);<br/>- matplotlib (to display data images).</div>
